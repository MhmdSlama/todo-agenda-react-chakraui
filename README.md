# ToDo Agenda  App

This project was created by using react and chakra ui for user interface.

It's my first react app and I focused on frontend part so I used JSON server to handle the backend part.

It is a simple to-do list where you add your tasks and select if you want reminder or not if yyou choose a reminder the an audio alert will go on on task's date you can close it by closing notification or it will goes of automatically after 10 seconds.

It also supports both light and dark mode.

I will add some more features when I finish them.
